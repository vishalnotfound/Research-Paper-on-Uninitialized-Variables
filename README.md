# Research Paper on Uninitialized Variables

This paper explores the unpredictability of values generated by uninitialized variables in C/C++ programming. It discusses how compilers handle these variables, factors contributing to randomness, and optimization techniques that impact their behavior.

## Topics Covered
- Uninitialized variables and garbage values
- Compiler behavior
- Memory architecture
- Factors influencing unpredictability (e.g., voltage fluctuations, optimization)
